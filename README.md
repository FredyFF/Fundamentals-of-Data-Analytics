### Who is a Data Analyst?
Data expert is a fairly broad term, and there may be differing views in terms of definition and scope. Let's start with a definition. Data analytics, in short, can be defined as a way to extract value from big data. Data analysts work with big data through exploration, analysis and visualization to extract important insights enabling business owners to make data-driven decisions.

### Analytics VS Other Data
The next thing people always ask is, ‘What is the difference between Data Analytics vs Business Intelligence vs Data Engineers vs Data Scientists vs Machine Learning?’.
- Data Analyst is a part of data science, whose job is to find answers to questions about what has happened, and see what value or learning we can take away.
- Data Engineers will prepare the foundation for data analysts to carry out work; they collect data and build data warehouses.
- Business Intelligence is somewhat similar to data analysis but heavier on business expertise or domain knowledge.
- Data Scientists create algorithms to create models and help inform overall organizational strategy.
- Machine Learning Engineers have special expertise in several fields, such as non-neural machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.
  
### The Data Analysis Process: A Step-by-Step Guide
The process of data analysis is a systematic approach that involves several stages
Step 1: Defining objectives and questions
The first step in the data analysis process is to define the objectives and formulate clear, specific questions that your analysis aims to answer. This step is crucial as it sets the direction for the entire process. It involves understanding the problem or situation at hand, identifying the data needed to address it, and defining the metrics or indicators to measure the outcomes.

Step 2: Data collection
Once the objectives and questions are defined, the next step is to collect the relevant data. This can be done through various methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, or extracting from existing databases. The data collected can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (non-numerical), depending on the nature of the problem and the questions being asked.

Step 3: Data cleaning
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves checking the data for errors and inconsistencies, and correcting or removing them. This step ensures the quality and reliability of the data, which is crucial for obtaining accurate and meaningful results from the analysis.

Step 4: Data analysis
Once the data is cleaned, it's time for the actual analysis. This involves applying statistical or mathematical techniques to the data to discover patterns, relationships, or trends. There are various tools and software available for this purpose, such as Python, R, Excel, and specialized software like SPSS and SAS.

Step 5: Data interpretation and visualization
After the data is analyzed, the next step is to interpret the results and visualize them in a way that is easy to understand. This could involve creating charts, graphs, or other visual representations of the data. Data visualization helps to make complex data more understandable and provides a clear picture of the findings.

Step 6: Data storytelling
The final step in the data analysis process is data storytelling. This involves presenting the findings of the analysis in a narrative form that is engaging and easy to understand. Data storytelling is crucial for communicating the results to non-technical audiences and for making data-driven decisions.

### The Types of Data Analysis
Data analysis can be categorized into four main types, each serving a unique purpose and providing different insights. These are descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analyses.

- Descriptive analysis
Descriptive analysis, as the name suggests, describes or summarizes raw data and makes it interpretable. It involves analyzing historical data to understand what has happened in the past. This type of analysis is used to identify patterns and trends over time. For example, a business might use descriptive analysis to understand the average monthly sales for the past year.

- Diagnostic analysis
Diagnostic analysis goes a step further than descriptive analysis by determining why something happened. It involves more detailed data exploration and comparing different data sets to understand the cause of a particular outcome. For instance, if a company's sales dropped in a particular month, diagnostic analysis could be used to find out why.

- Predictive analysis
Predictive analysis uses statistical models and forecasting techniques to understand the future. It involves using data from the past to predict what could happen in the future. This type of analysis is often used in risk assessment, marketing, and sales forecasting. For example, a company might use predictive analysis to forecast the next quarter's sales based on historical data.

- Prescriptive analysis
Prescriptive analysis is the most advanced type of data analysis. It not only predicts future outcomes but also suggests actions to benefit from these predictions. It uses sophisticated tools and technologies like machine learning and artificial intelligence to recommend decisions.


### Data Analysis Techniques
There are numerous techniques used in data analysis, each with its unique purpose and application. Here, we will discuss some of the most commonly used techniques, including exploratory analysis, regression analysis, factor analysis, and others.

- Exploratory analysis
Exploratory analysis is used to understand the main characteristics of a data set. It is often used at the beginning of a data analysis process to summarize the main aspects of the data, check for missing data, and test assumptions. This technique involves visual methods such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.
You can learn more about exploratory data analysis with our course, covering how to explore, visualize, and extract insights from data using Python.

- Regression analysis
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for forecasting, time series modeling, and finding the causal effect relationships between variables.

### Daily Life of a Data Analyst
There will be differences in all organizations, but here is an overview of a typical day in the life of a Data Analyst

### Important Steps in Data Analytics
- Problem definition and hypothesis
Data analytics is not just about coding. To carry out an analysis, first of course you need to define the existing problem. This can be a pitfall or pitfall for many data analysts. This requires analytical thinking and problem solving, interpreting business requirements to guide data analysis, and starting to design your data project.
You need proper documentation; many call it PRD (Project Requirement Document). Amazon has a "narrative" style to guide projects and set goals.
Amazon uses a narrative consisting of:
- Objective
- Background
- Hypothesis
- Initiative Details

Including all stakeholders and processes involved. In this way, you can connect business objectives with data analysis.
For example, if you are building a new product, you do not have the data yet. Which is why you need to conduct experiments to test the beta version of a product to different customers. You need to do random sampling, but you need to make sure the sample is representative to the customers that you are targeting. You can design the experiment to test different things, A/B  Testing by changing colors or UX of the product. The data can be qualitative such as interview results, or it can be quantitative, like the NPS (Net Promoter Score). Conducting analysis for these experiments or hypothesis testing is also something that will be learned during the weeks in the RevoU data analytics program.

- Data collection
Second, after a clear goal and background have been identified from the problem statement, you need to determine what data will be collected to solve the problem.This data may already exist or you may need to find it from secondary data or interviews. Data is not always quantitative; it can also be qualitative. The rule of thumb is to have at least two or more sources (and make sure the data is valid).
In some cases, if the data doesn't exist yet, you need to create an experiment to get the data. To conduct an experiment, you need to define a business question, create a hypothesis, and determine how you will test and obtain data. Usually, this part is carried out by the growth project team in a company.
For example, if you are creating a new product, you don't have data yet. That's why you need to conduct experiments to test the beta version of a product on different customers.
You need to do random sampling, but you also need to make sure the sample represents the customers you are targeting or not. You can design experiments to test various things, A/B testing by changing the colors or UX (User Experience) of the product. The data can be qualitative such as interview results, or it can also be quantitative such as NPS (Net Promoter Score).

- Data preparation & transformation
Then, once the data set is ready, you need to prepare it before carrying out the analysis. What does it mean to "prepare data"? Well, not all data sets are ideal for you.
Some data points will be further from the average; there are 'outliers'. This is different from existing data. To do this, you need to have statistical indicators, such as the mean (average) and standard deviation.
The reason behind data cleaning is simple, you need to provide good insights, so you need data that can help get you there. Let's see below what outliers can do to your conclusions. Imagine you have a data set: 50,15,12,13,15,15.As you can probably easily see, 50 is completely different from the other numbers, so it is an outlier.

- Analyze the data
After you prepare and get clean data, it's time for you to do some data analysis. Depending on the type of data you obtain and the problem you want to solve, there are various analysis methods you can use. If you do descriptive analysis, some of the output can be:
- KPI dashboard
- Monthly income report
- Overview of sales prospects

Or maybe you do diagnostic analysis to find out 'why'. For example, a SaaS startup needs to know which marketing activities increase the number of free trials. Basically, this is the part where you do your work to analyze the data
There are several ways to analyze data, including:
- Causal Impact Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Regression Analysis
- Cohort Analysis
- Segmentation (Clustering, Decision Tree)
- Time series & Forecasting

- Visualization & communication
This is the most interesting part of data analysis, visualize the data! Many people may underestimate how important this part is for making data-driven decisions.
However, many people don't realize that many data analysts are weak in this area by not putting themselves in the stakeholder position. The essence of data analysis is how to produce insights through visualization that can be easily understood by stakeholders.
