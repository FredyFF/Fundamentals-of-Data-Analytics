Fundamentals of Data Analytics

Data analysis is a comprehensive method of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making. It is a multifaceted process involving various techniques and methodologies to interpret data from various sources in different formats, both structured and unstructured.

In this article, we will give you a good look at the data analysis. If, at the end, you want to explore the field, follow up with our companion article called, How to Become a Data Analyst, which covers everything you need to know about launching your career and the skills you’ll need to master.

### Who is a Data Analyst?
Data expert is a fairly broad term, and there may be differing views in terms of definition and scope. Let's start with a definition. Data analytics, in short, can be defined as a way to extract value from big data. Data analysts work with big data through exploration, analysis and visualization to extract important insights enabling business owners to make data-driven decisions.

### Analytics VS Other Data
The next thing people always ask is, ‘What is the difference between Data Analytics vs Business Intelligence vs Data Engineers vs Data Scientists vs Machine Learning?’.
- Data Analyst is a part of data science, whose job is to find answers to questions about what has happened, and see what value or learning we can take away.
- Data Engineers will prepare the foundation for data analysts to carry out work; they collect data and build data warehouses.
- Business Intelligence is somewhat similar to data analysis but heavier on business expertise or domain knowledge.
- Data Scientists create algorithms to create models and help inform overall organizational strategy.
- Machine Learning Engineers have special expertise in several fields, such as non-neural machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.
  
### The Data Analysis Process: A Step-by-Step Guide
The process of data analysis is a systematic approach that involves several stages
Step 1: Defining objectives and questions
The first step in the data analysis process is to define the objectives and formulate clear, specific questions that your analysis aims to answer. This step is crucial as it sets the direction for the entire process. It involves understanding the problem or situation at hand, identifying the data needed to address it, and defining the metrics or indicators to measure the outcomes.

Step 2: Data collection
Once the objectives and questions are defined, the next step is to collect the relevant data. This can be done through various methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, or extracting from existing databases. The data collected can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (non-numerical), depending on the nature of the problem and the questions being asked.

Step 3: Data cleaning
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing, is a critical step in the data analysis process. It involves checking the data for errors and inconsistencies, and correcting or removing them. This step ensures the quality and reliability of the data, which is crucial for obtaining accurate and meaningful results from the analysis.

Step 4: Data analysis
Once the data is cleaned, it's time for the actual analysis. This involves applying statistical or mathematical techniques to the data to discover patterns, relationships, or trends. There are various tools and software available for this purpose, such as Python, R, Excel, and specialized software like SPSS and SAS.

Step 5: Data interpretation and visualization
After the data is analyzed, the next step is to interpret the results and visualize them in a way that is easy to understand. This could involve creating charts, graphs, or other visual representations of the data. Data visualization helps to make complex data more understandable and provides a clear picture of the findings.

Step 6: Data storytelling
The final step in the data analysis process is data storytelling. This involves presenting the findings of the analysis in a narrative form that is engaging and easy to understand. Data storytelling is crucial for communicating the results to non-technical audiences and for making data-driven decisions.
